"Extreme cold events cold snaps, cold waves, polar vortex","The polar vortex is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding the Earth's North and South poles. Often during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the polar vortex will become less stable and expand, sending cold Arctic air southward over the United States with the jet stream. A cold wave, sometimes known as a cold snap or deep freeze, is a weather event involving a cooling of the air, or the invasion of very cold air, over a large area. It is marked by a drop of average temperature well below the averages of a region",,
"Extreme heat events, including urban heat island effects heat waves","Extreme heat events, including urban heat island effects are a period of abnormally hot weather. [Special Report Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation]. Heat waves are defined as relatively dry daytime heat waves or humid nighttime events that are associated with higher human morbidity and mortality. Heat waves are projected to increase in intensity over the coming decades. Heatwaves will become more intense in the future. Heat waves are identified as one of the extreme climate events changing due to anthropogenic climate change. Effects of increasing temperatures have resulted in an increase in the frequency of heatwaves. Warming is expected to increase the likelihood of extremely hot days and nights.   ",,
Droughts,"Drought is a period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance. A period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is defined as a meteorological drought. A megadrought is a very lengthy and pervasive drought, lasting much longer than normal, usually a decade or more. Surface soil moisture availability, which is a critical diagnostic metric for drought, is projected to decrease and lead to an increase in drought caused by evaporative demands. With increased drought frequency come associated impacts such as poor soil quality and increased erosion potential",,
"Extreme rainfall with Inland or Coastal Flooding, extreme rainfall, inland flooding; coastal flooding, heavy downpours","An episode of abnormally high rain or snow. The definition of extreme is a statistical concept that varies depending on location, season, and length of the historical record. Increases in the intensity or frequency of heavy precipitation are key factors that affect the_risk of_floods and flash floods. While there is no single definition of extreme rainfall, per se, a good benchmark is a month's worth of rain for a given location falling in one day. Flood is the overflowing of the normal confines of a stream or other body of water, or the accumulation of water over areas that are not normally submerged. Floods include river (fluvial) floods, flash floods, urban floods, pluvial floods, sewer floods, coastal floods, and glacial lake outburst floods.",,
"Extreme snow and ice storms, Extreme winter precipitation, blizzard, ice storm, sleet, freezing rain","Blizzards are dangerous winter storms that are a combination of blowing snow and wind resulting in very low visibilities. While heavy snowfalls and severe cold often accompany blizzards, they are not required. Sometimes strong winds pick up snow that has already fallen, creating a ground blizzard. An ice storm is a storm which results in the accumulation of at least .25 of ice on exposed surfaces. They create hazardous driving and walking conditions. Tree branches and powerlines can easily snap under the weight of the ice.",,
Tropical cyclones and Hurricanes,"Tropical  cyclone is a strong, cyclonic-scale disturbance  that  originates  over  tropical  oceans. Beyond threshold windspeed, a tropical  cyclone  is called a  hurricane, typhoon, or  cyclone,  depending  on geographic  location. The world is already experiencing the effects of climate change in the form of intense tropical cyclones. Increasing evidence shows that tropical cyclone intensity and precipitation will increase because of climate change.  It is also shown that the spatial distribution of tropical cyclones may change in the future climate, with decreased tropical cyclone counts over the southern Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean and increased counts over the central Atlantic."" ",,
Extratropical cyclones,Extratropical  Cyclone is any  cyclonic-scale storm  that  is not  a  tropical  cyclone. Usually  refers  to  a middle-  or  high-latitude migratory  storm  system  formed in regions of  large horizontal  temperature variations. Sometimes called  extratropical  storm  or  extratropical  low. ,,
Wildfires,"Wildfires are unplanned fires that burn in natural areas like forests, grasslands or prairies. These dangerous fires spread quickly and can devastate not only wildfire and natural areas, but also communities. The world is already experiencing the effects of climate change in the form of increased numbers of wildfires. The contribution of the climate to wildfire ignition, intensity, and spread is dictated by precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns, which, in turn, affect vegetation type/distribution.",,
"Severe convective storms, Thunderstorms and Tornados, Lightning, Extreme winds, Heavy Precipitation, Hail, hailstorm","Convective storms or Thunderstorms, as they are more commonly referred to in the UK, are severe local storms associated with thunder, lightning, heavy rain, hail, strong winds and sudden changes in temperature. They can occur all year round but are most common during the summer months. Severe convective storms are among the most common, most damaging natural catastrophes in the United States. The result of warm, moist air rising from the earth, they manifest in various ways, depending on atmospheric conditions - from drenching thunderstorms with lightning, to tornadoes, hail, or destructive straight-line winds.",,
Rising Surface Temperatures,"Global warming is the estimated increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) averaged over a 30-year period, or the 30-year period centered on a particular year or decade, expressed relative to pre-industrial levels unless otherwise specified. For 30-year periods that span past and future years, the current multi-decadal warming trend is assumed to continue.  Effects of increasing temperatures have resulted in an increase in the length of the frost-free season since the early 1900s and an increase in the frequency of heatwaves since the mid-1960s. The length of the frost-free season (and the corresponding growing season) has been increasing and is projected to continue to lengthen, affecting ecosystems and agriculture.  ",,
Permafrost Thaw,"Permafrost is ground (soil or rock and included ice and organic material) that remains at or below zero degree centigrade for at least two consecutive years. Progressive loss of ground ice in permafrost, usually due to input of heat. Thaw can occur over decades to centuries over the entire depth of permafrost ground, with impacts occurring while thaw progresses. During thaw, temperature fluctuations are subdued because energy is transferred by phase change between ice and water. After the transition from permafrost to non-permafrost, ground can be described as thawed. Permafrost degradation is a major threat to Arctic communities and ecosystems, but it also extends beyond the region, as it contributes to climate change and the positive feedback loop which threatens to push our planet into an environmental crisis.  Permafrost covers 24 percent of the surface of land masses in the northern hemisphere and accounts for nearly half of all organic carbon stored within the planet's soil. As long as this organic matter remains frozen, it will stay trapped in the permafrost. However, if it thaws, microbes will begin to eat the material, causing it to decay and releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Even if a small fraction of these greenhouse gases are released, it will have major consequences on not only the Arctic, but Earth's entire climate system, as they intensify global climate change.",,
"Snow cover snow pack, snowmelt timing, snow drought",The world is already experiencing the effects of climate change in the form of loss of snow cover. Warmer temperatures have been linked to changes in snowpack thickness and density snow-water equivalent (SWE) and snowmelt timing. Snow drought is a period of abnormally little snowpack for the time of year.,,
Loss of arctic sea ice and glaciers,"Sea ice is ice found at the sea surface that has originated from the freezing of seawater. Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice floes) moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast ice). Sea ice concentration is the fraction of the ocean covered by ice. Sea ice less than one year old is called first-year ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that survives at least one summer.  The world is already experiencing the effects of climate change in the form of the loss of Arctic sea ice. The consequences of climate change include melting ice sheets.",,
"(Ground) Drying trend, precipitation variability trend, dry days","Projected trends in temperature are expected to have a significant impact on evaporation, which will severely impact the water budget, imposing long-term deficits of water (Collins et al. 2013, Dai 2013, Wehner et al. 2017). As a result, surface soil moisture availability, which is a critical diagnostic metric for drought, is projected to decrease (Hayhoe et al. 2018) and lead to an increase in drought caused by evaporative demands. More frequent dry days punctuated by more frequent heavy rainfall events, with moderate spectrum events decreasing in frequency. Near-surface soil moisture is projected to decrease throughout the entire United States, which implies that future droughts are projected to become more frequent and intense, and persist for longer periods. In combination with lower soil moisture, decreased precipitation in the West and Southwest will further exacerbate drought frequency, intensity, and duration. ",,
"Sea level rise, coastal flooding, storm surge","Sea Level Rise is due to the oceans absorbing increased atmospheric heat associated with emissions from human activity. Like mercury in a thermometer, water expands as it warms up (this is referred to as ""thermal expansion"") causing sea levels to rise. Melting of glaciers and ice sheets is also contributing to sea level rise at increasing rates. Coastal areas will see continued sea level rise throughout the 21st century, contributing to more frequent and severe coastal flooding in low-lying areas and coastal erosion. Storm surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides. This rise in water level can cause extreme flooding in coastal areas particularly when storm surge coincides with normal high tide.  ",,
Ocean acidification,"Ocean acidification refers to a reduction in the pH of the ocean over an extended period, typically decades or longer, which is caused primarily by uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, but can also be caused by other chemical additions or subtractions from the ocean. Anthropogenic ocean acidification refers to the component of pH reduction that is caused by human activity.  ",,
Carbon dioxide fertilization ,Carbon dioxide fertilization is the enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration,,
"Rising ocean temperatures, sea surface temperatures","Much of the heat trapped by increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels is absorbed by the ocean, causing ocean temperatures to rise. Sea surface temperature-the temperature of the water at the ocean surface-is an important physical attribute of the world's oceans. The surface temperature of the world's oceans varies mainly with latitude, with the warmest waters generally near the equator and the coldest waters in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. As the oceans absorb more heat, sea surface temperature increases, and the ocean circulation patterns that transport warm and cold water around the globe change. ",,
